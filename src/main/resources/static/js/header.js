/**
 * Header Navigation - Library-First Implementation
 * The main Alpine.js component function (headerNavigation) has been moved to common-scripts.html
 * to ensure it loads before Alpine.js initializes.
 * 
 * This file is kept for potential page-specific header customizations.
 * Uses: Alpine.js (state management) + Headroom.js (scroll effects) + Tailwind CSS (styling)
 * Replaced 170+ lines of custom JavaScript with ~50 lines using libraries
 */

// Header functionality is now initialized via Alpine.js component in common-scripts.html
console.log('Header.js loaded - using Alpine.js component from common-scripts');
